# DNS Services Website

## Overview
DNS Services is a cloud hosting platform providing virtual private servers (VPS), dedicated servers, domain registration, and related services. This repository hosts the source code for the DNS Services website (https://www.github.com/tahabangyal/webprogramming), developed using PHP for backend logic, HTML/CSS for structure and styling, and JavaScript for client-side interactivity.

## Features
- **User Management**: Secure user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Hosting Services**: Dynamic display of VPS and dedicated server plans with customizable options.
- **Domain Registration**: Real-time domain availability checks and registration via external APIs.
- **Payment Integration**: Secure transaction processing through payment gateways.
- **User Dashboard**: Interface for managing hosting plans, domains, and backups.
- **Responsive Design**: Cross-device compatibility with modern CSS and JavaScript.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: PHP 8.1+ for server-side processing.
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Database**: MySQL 5.7+ for storing user, plan, and transaction data.
- **Web Server**: LiteSpeed on a Linux environment.
- **Dependencies**: Managed via Composer for PHP and npm (optional) for frontend.
- **APIs**: Integration with domain registries, payment gateways (e.g., PayFast), and server provisioning services.

## Prerequisites
- PHP 8.1 or later
- MySQL 5.7 or later
- Composer for PHP dependencies
- Node.js and npm (optional, for frontend build tools)
- API credentials for domain registries, payment gateways, and hosting services

## Usage
- **Public Interface**: Browse hosting plans, register domains, or create an account via the main website.
- **API Endpoints**: Interact programmatically via `/api` (see API documentation, if provided).

## Security Practices
- Use prepared statements for MySQL queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Implement CSRF tokens for form submissions.
- Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords) in `config.php` or environment variables.
- Enforce HTTPS in production to secure data transmission.

## Performance Optimization
- Cache frequently accessed data using Memcached or file-based caching.
- Minify CSS and JavaScript files for faster page loads.
- Optimize database queries with indexing for plan and user data.
